# Purpose

This is a library that is intended to be used to generate ray traced scenes. I had originally implemented this in Clojure but I wanted to learn more about Swift by reimplementing it in that language. It's a library instead of an application like POV-Ray, but there is a component in it that allows you to easily create an object scene by expressing it in a Swift DSL, and then render it to a file. Moreover, since you can use Xcode to type in a scene, you can take advantage of its own features like type-checking and fixits, which were not possible using Clojure. As with the Clojure implementation, this one is based on the tests provided by the amazing book, The Ray Tracer Challenge by Jamis Buck.

# Features

This ray tracer allows you to describe and render scenes using a light source, a camera, and a collection of shapes, each shape having an associated material. Shapes can then be combined with each other using constructive solid geometry.

## Shapes

The following shapes are available:

| Shape | Defaults |
| --- | --- |
| Plane | Lies in the xz-plane |
| Sphere | Centered at the origin and has radius of one unit |
| Cube | Centered at the origin and has "radius" of one unit |
| Cone | Centered at the origin, has radius of one unit and infinite length along the y-axis, and has exposed caps |
| Cylinder | Centered at the origin, has radius of one unit and infinite length along the y-axis, and has exposed caps |
| Torus | Centered at the origin, lies in the xz-plane, had major radius of two and a minor radius of one |

Currently, all shapes must minimally be constructed with a `Material`, the details of which explained below.

All shapes also have the following property modifiers for setting/updating the underlying transformation matrix:

* `translate(_ x: Double, _ y: Double, _ z: Double)`
* `scale(_ x: Double, _ y: Double, _ z: Double)`
* `rotateX(_ t: Double)`
* `rotateY(_ t: Double)`
* `rotateZ(_ t: Double)`
* `shear(_ xy: Double, _ xz: Double, _ yx: Double, _ yz: Double, _ zx: Double, _ zy: Double)`

This means that you can chain operations together in a logical manner and not have to explicitly `let` out a transformation matrix and then pass it in to the shape's constructor, like this:

```swift
Cube(.basicMaterial())
    .shear(1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0)
    .scale(1, 2, 3)
    .rotateX(PI/3)
    .rotateY(PI/3)
    .rotateZ(PI/3)
    .translate(0, 1, 2)
```

The implementation applies the underlying transformation matrices in reverse order, so the programmer isn't burdened with those details and instead can simply chain operations in an intuitive manner.

## Materials

Currently materials employ either a solid color or a pattern, as well as have the following other attributes:

| Property | Range of values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ambient reflectance | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| diffuse reflectance | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| specular reflectance | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| shininess | 0.0 - âˆž |
| reflective index | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| transparency | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| refractive index | 1.0 - 2.5|

There is a default material, `Material.basicMaterial()`, that can be used as a convenience, with default values for all of the other attributes, or you can instantiate a `Material` with either another solid color or a pattern, namely `.solidColor()` and `.pattern()`, respectively.


Like `Shape`, `Material` has property modifers which can be used to specify values for the other attributes without having to pass non-default values for them all at once:

* `.ambient(_ n: Double)`
* `.diffuse(_ n: Double)`
* `.specular(_ n: Double)`
* `.shininess(_ n: Double)`
* `.reflective(_ n: Double)`
* `.transparency(_ n: Double)`
* `.refractive(_ n: Double)`

The following patterns are available:

* Stripes
`Pattern(_ firstColor: Color, _ secondColor: Color, _ transform: Matrix4)`

* 2D checkerboard
`Checkered2D(_ firstColor: Color, _ secondColor: Color, _ transform: Matrix4)`

* 3D checkerboard
`Checkered3D(_ firstColor: Color, _ secondColor: Color, _ transform: Matrix4)`

* Gradient
`Gradient(_ firstColor: Color, _ secondColor: Color, _ transform: Matrix4)`

## Constructive solid geometry

There are three supported operations for combining various shapes:

* Union
* Intersection
* Difference

The implementation for CSG takes advantage of so-called result builders, a feature of Swift that allows the programmer to list parameters to a function with minimal punctuation. Furthermore, Scintilla is responsible for nesting pairs of CSG operations so you don't have to, and so you can express the subtraction of three cylinders from a sphere like this:

```swift
Sphere(.solidColor(Color(0, 0, 1)))
    .difference {
        Cylinder(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
            .scale(0.6, 0.6, 0.6)
        Cylinder(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
            .scale(0.6, 0.6, 0.6)
            .rotateZ(PI/2)
        Cylinder(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
            .scale(0.6, 0.6, 0.6)
            .rotateX(PI/2)
    }
```

... instead of having to do this:

```swift
CSG(.difference,
    CSG(.difference,
        CSG(.difference,
            Sphere(.solidColor(Color(0, 0, 1))),
            Cylinder(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
                .scale(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)),
        Cylinder(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
            .scale(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
            .rotateZ(PI/2)),
    Cylinder(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
        .scale(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
        .rotateX(PI/2))
```

You can even use `for` loops in the middle of an expression to accomplish the same:

```swift
Sphere(.solidColor(Color(0, 0, 1)))
    .difference {
        for (thetaX, thetaZ) in [(0, 0), (0, PI/2), (PI/2, 0)] {
            Cylinder(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
                .scale(0.6, 0.6, 0.6)
                .rotateX(thetaX)
                .rotateZ(thetaZ)
        }
    }
```

You can also chain calls to `.union()`, `.intersection()`, and `.difference()` to create complex shapes:

```swift
Sphere(.solidColor(Color(0, 0, 1)))
    .intersection {
        Cube(.solidColor(Color(1, 0, 0)))
            .scale(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)
    }
    .difference {
        for (thetaX, thetaZ) in [(0, 0), (0, PI/2), (PI/2, 0)] {
            Cylinder(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
                .scale(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
                .rotateX(thetaX)
                .rotateZ(thetaZ)
        }
    }
```

## Constructing a scene

To construct a scene, you need to create a `World` instance with the following objects

* a `Light`
* a `Camera`
* a body of `Shape`s

A `Light` only requires a point tuple to represent its origin. A `Camera` takes three tuples: the point designating its origin, the point designating where it is pointing at, and a vector representing which way is up.

`World` also supports enumerating shapes using result builders, so you can do the following:

```swift
World {
    Light(point(-10, 10, -10))
    Camera(800, 600, PI/3, .view(
        point(0, 3, -5),
        point(0, 0, 0),
        vector(0, 1, 0)))
    Sphere(.solidColor(Color(1, 0, 0)))
        .translate(-2, 0, 0)
    Sphere(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
    Sphere(.solidColor(Color(0, 0, 1)))
        .translate(2, 0, 0)
```

Note the lack of commas separating the parameters to the `World` constructor as well as not needing brackets around the `Sphere` objects.

## Rendering a scene

Scintilla comes with a component that allows you to easily create an application and render a scene. In order to do this, first create a new Xcode project, using the Command Line Tool template. 

![](./images/CLI_template.png)

Next add Scintilla as a package dependency via File -> Add Packages; in that dialog box, enter the URL of this Git repository and click Add Package. Xcode should successfully download the library and add it to the project.

Now that you're ready to use Scintilla, all you need to do is create a new Swift file, say `MyWorld.swift`. Add the following code as an example scene:

```swift
import ScintillaLib

@main
struct MyWorld: ScintillaApp {
    var body: World {
        Light(point(-10, 10, -10))
        Camera(800, 600, PI/3, .view(
            point(0, 10, -15),
            point(0, 0, 0),
            vector(0, 1, 0)))
        Sphere(.solidColor(Color(0, 0, 1)))
            .intersection {
                Cube(.solidColor(Color(1, 0, 0)))
                    .scale(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)
            }
            .difference {
                for (thetaX, thetaZ) in [(0, 0), (0, PI/2), (PI/2, 0)] {
                    Cylinder(.solidColor(Color(0, 1, 0)))
                        .scale(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
                        .rotateX(thetaX)
                        .rotateZ(thetaZ)
                }
            }
            .rotateY(PI/6)
    }
}
```

Please note the following about the example above:

* You must `import ScintillaLib`
* You need to annotate the struct with `@main`
* Your struct must conform to the `ScintallaApp` protocol
* The struct must have the `body` property, which is of type `World`

If you've done all that, you now have a bona fide application and should be able to run it through Xcode. And if all goes well, you should see the file `MyWorld.ppm` on your desktop and it should look like this:
